# Specifications:

# â€¢	Director class
#     o	Method start_game() that contains and continually calls three methods, get_inputs(), do_updates(), give_outputs()
#     o	__init__ will get a word from Words(), creates an instance of Guess(), and create a new instance of Parachute().
#     o	Call Guess.get_guess() in get_inputs() (NOT TRUE ANYMORE)
#     o	Check if the guess is correct with Guess() in do_updates()
#     o	Check if the guess is incorrect with Parachute in do_updates()
#     o	Print the current guess and parachute in give_outputs()
#     o	If game is over according to Guess() or Parachute(), end the gameplay loop in start_game()
#
#     IGNORE THE ABOVE
#     
#     __init__ will create instances of all other classes
#     start_game() will contain all other non-init methods
#     _get_inputs() will run Guess.get_guess()
#     _do_updates() runs all update methods in parachute and guess, including an exit if the
#       parachute is fully gone or the word is fully guessed
#     _give_outputs() prints the parachute and the current word state
#       We also want something extra to signal the game has ended, but this can be in start_game()      
#       We will use Encapsulation throughout

    This class connects all other classes in order for the game to operate. It uses encapsulation throughout. 
    The start_game function runs the game. It calls the get_input, do_updates and give_outputs.
    Get_inputs asks the user to provide an input. It will keep asking unless a user provides a valid input(single letter, no spaces or characters).
    Do_updates checks if the input is in the word(via guess). If it is not then a part of the parachute is removed(parachute).
    Give_outputs prints the blank words and correct guessed words, as well as draws the parachute.
